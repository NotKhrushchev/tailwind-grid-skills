                        heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
                        of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software
                        Engineer at a VR startup.”

                            professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                            team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers. 100% recommend!”
